## What Users Say

- (...) your UI pack for VDH is awesome, switched from the Afenar and not going back. The sound cues are great
- Iâ€™m new to DH this expansion and started playing with your WA, first day or 2 i was like what the fuck is this sneeze. Now it gives me life
- most of my ui is naowh turned to my likings just using xeph's package cuz it looks nice and i love the highlighters
- Using your newest addition of Aug and Dev and it is the best so far !

## Mounting

The entire suite fades to 40% opacity if you're on a mount. You can customize the degree of opacity in the Options of `MountOpacityTrigger`.

## 1440p Resolution compatibility

The suite is technically pixel perfect for 1440p and I'll maintain it this way going forward. But for that, your screen resolution needs to be 1440p (or higher) compatible.

I've separated a small UI Utils aura [here](https://wago.io/dX5H_AygQ) as not everyone is on 1440p. If you are and aren't already using something similar, I'l highly recommend using that one too. Note that changing your screen resolution will likely affect other addon placements on the screen too, e.g. `Details` windows.
